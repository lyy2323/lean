猫猫

Once upon a they time, in a cozy little house, there lived a cat named Whiskers. Whiskers was a fluffy, white cat with big, green eyes. She loved to sleep in the warm sun and chase her tail.
One sunny afternoon, Whiskers saw a butterfly fluttering by the window. She jumped up and pounced, but the butterfly flew away. Whiskers chased it all around the garden. She ran so fast that she almost tripped over a flower pot!
Finally, Whiskers caught the butterfly. She looked at it and then let it go. She didn't want to hurt her new friend. The butterfly flew away, and Whiskers felt happy. She lay down in the soft grass and took a nap.
When she woke up, she saw her owner, a little girl named Lucy, sitting on the porch. Lucy smiled and called Whiskers over. She gave her a treat, and Whiskers purred with joy. She loved her home and her family.
